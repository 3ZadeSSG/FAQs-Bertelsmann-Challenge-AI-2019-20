# Few details about the course contents and upcoming activities

**Q: Is there any collab projects are there for the challenge near future?**
-   There will be an opportunity for collaboration in our project showcase that will happen towards the end of Phase 1. In the meantime, you can collab on ideas to enrich this community whether that be host an AMA, a live webinar - pitch us your best ideas!

**Q: Just wondering if it does it matter if we log into the course regularly (in the sense of a certain number of times per week) for moving onto phase 2? Due to other commitments, many people will not be able to do this. I know you want to see steady progress but is it OK if it's once every other week or so?**
-   All that matters is that your coursework and the final Challenge project is completed by the January 9th deadline.  While steady progress is recommended so you don't find yourself in pickle as the deadline draws near, we understand everyone has busy schedules. As was said previously - while it's not mandatory to devote huge chunks at a time to either your coursework or your community involvement even if you're able to devote 15-20 min here and there we see that and appreciate it as every little bit helps!
