# Lab challenge

**Q: What are the tips and tricks that could be helpful in the Lab challenge**

  This is a resource created by @mhendri : [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-MCDPOejsn2hq9EoBzMpzGv9jEdtMWoIwjkAa1cVbSM/edit#heading=h.nj23sjpj5u97)

**Q: After submission of the Final Project will there be a second chance if I don’t pass?**

  You can submit as many times as you like. The best result will be considered for your final score.

**Q: Can I see my accuracy on the test set after passing?**

No, there is no further information available.

**Q: I got this error: `"RuntimeError: cuda runtime error (2) : out of memory`**

  Restart your kernel and try decreasing your batch size and/or using a simpler model.

**Q: Will I have to save my model in CPU instead of GPU to load it properly?**

  Answered by @Vittorio Nardone

  >If you have already saved model checkpoint from GPU, you can try this to load it in CPU env: checkpoint = torch.load(filename, map_location=lambda storage, loc: storage)
  
  Alternatively, you can put your model onto the CPU before saving by using model.cpu()

**Q: Will I have to train my model on pytorch 0.4.0 to pass the test?**

**Q: Is it possible to see how the test-set accuracy is being calculated (not the value) There's a lot of confusion if someone uses a non-convential way to do the assignments...**
-   Unfortunately, these details can not be shared. 
=======
No, if you train your model on a later version of pytorch then to pass you should include strict=False when loading the state_dict, i.e. 
model.load_state_dict(checkpoint[‘state_dict’], strict=False)

**Q: How can I use ResNet given that it does not have a classifier?**

Put your classifier on the final layer of the model (the fully connected layer) model.fc = classifier
