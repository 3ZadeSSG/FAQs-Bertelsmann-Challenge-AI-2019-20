# Diiferent inquiries surrounding the course

**Q: When we have an announcement, it shows a `1` written aside the channel name. But I, for some announcements, don't see that. So, I miss some announcements when they are posted.**
-   Slack workspace is being picky with regards to those notifications! To make sure you don't miss any, I would periodically check our [PyTorch Challenge site](https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/pytorch-scholarship-facebook/announcements)

**Q: Is participating in a study group make any impact to get selected in phase 2 apart from other requirements?**
-   Participating in a given study group is not a requirement. What matters is overall participation in the Slack community.

**Q: How do we contact the student leader in our channels? Do we have a list?**
-   You can have all the SL [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eTaHfnZ6nCXKsC5m5iLsejfV8IwfE0NgD2uhzH_Azws/edit?usp=sharing).

**Q: Can you share about your success journey with Udacity? Is there any future opportunity to get chance work with Facebook? In this challenge would we have surprises? Can we be authorized to organized events that expand our knowledge and skills?**
-   We do have things planned and we promise to share when the time comes! You are definitely encouraged to organize events - if you do, please post them to our private Facebook group so others can participate!

**Q:Is there any chance that the top 300 cap (selection) will be increased to higher number?**
-   Unfortunately no. Everything is already set up with Facebook who is giving the scholarships and it is unlikely that the number will be changed.

**Q: what would one consider as a  "deep impact" or good result from a channel or study group, of course after that all members finish their course.**
-   Definitely that everyone in the Study Group completes the Challenge first and foremost! An cherry on top would be if the group was also able to create a project that showcased what was learned from the Challenge material. Although the last is completely not mandatory or necessary!

**Q: Are there any relevant job opportunities for those best 300 from phase 1?**
-   Udacity provide carrier services which makes you prepare for the right job and certificate enhance your skills to make your chances blow into opportunities.
-   A Deep Learning Nanodegree will truly provide you with the skills you need. In the meantime, here is the link to [Udacity's Career Resources Center](https://career-resource-center.udacity.com/) to help prepare you when you are ready to start your job search.

**Q: About our side or group projects, how do you suggest publishing and sharing them? Maybe in a blog and then repost it to the Facebook group or directly in facebook album?**
-   We share the details once we announce the program. In the meantime, sharing here in Slack in the new #side-projects channel and in a blog is a fantastic idea - especially as the facebook group is private.
