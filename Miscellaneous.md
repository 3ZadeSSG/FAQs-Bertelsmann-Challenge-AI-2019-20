# Diiferent inquiries surrounding the course


**Q1: Is participating in a study group make any impact to get selected in phase 2 apart from other requirements?**
-   Participating in a given study group is not a requirement. What matters is overall participation in the Slack community.

**Q2: what would one consider as a  "deep impact" or good result from a channel or study group, of course after that all members finish their course.**
-   Definitely that everyone in the Study Group completes the Challenge first and foremost! An cherry on top would be if the group was also able to create a project that showcased what was learned from the Challenge material. Although the last is completely not mandatory or necessary!

**Q3: Do student leaders need to submit any reports?**
-   No formal reports are required but please do check in by attending the weekly SL meetings if you can which are helld in the private SL channel.

**Q4: Do student leaders have more chance of getting selected for the nanodegree?**
-   Being a Student Leader doesn't guarantee anything. You still need to participate, put in the work and make sure that your model is good enough.
