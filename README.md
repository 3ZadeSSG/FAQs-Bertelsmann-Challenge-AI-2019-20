# FAQs Bertelsmann Tech Scholarship Challenge Course - AI Track
FAQs in Slack channel of Udacity's Bertelsmann Tech Scholarship Challenge Course - AI Track

# Why we have created this repo?
All the channels of our Slack community are constantly buzzing with great questions and amazing solutions. These solutions can be in the form of lucid explanations from our peers or references to some awesome resources. But due to a limitation in free plan of Slack, we can search upto last 10K messages. Due to this, we are loosing the efforts of our peers and all the  resources. To prevent this loss of invaluable resources, we have created this repo where we would be regularly adding frequently asked questions and the possible solutions shared by our peers in the Slack channels. Also, this repo would help newer students of this course as they would find solutions to most of the common problems at a single place. We hope to make this repo useful for not only the students of Bertelsmann Challenge Program, but also for students of upcoming scholarship programs and they will be able to fork this repo and modify this accordin to their need, just like this repo was forked and modified from original repo which was based on Facebook AI PyTorch Scholarship

# How can I contribute?
We would love to have contribution from other students as well and welcome all your suggestions to improve this repo. Please do not hesitate to make a pull request if you feel it can add any value to the repo, every bit of effort matters. If you have any queries or suggestions, you can DM me at my Slack id <@c0mp1ex> or open a new github issue. Looking forward to contributions from you. Thanks.
