# FAQs
FAQs in Slack channel of Udacity's PyTorch Scholarship Challenge.

# Why we have created this repo?
All the channels of our Slack community are constantly buzzing with great questions and amazing solutions. These solutions can be in the form of lucid explanations from our peers or references to some awesome resources. But due to a limitation in free plan of Slack, we can search upto last 10K messages. Due to this, we are loosing the efforts of our peers and all the  resources. To prevent this loss of invaluable resources, we have created this repo where we would be regularly adding frequently asked questions and the possible solutions shared by our peers in the Slack channels. Also, this repo would help newer students of this course as they would find solutions to most of the common problems at a single place. We hope to make this repo useful for not only the students of pytorch scholarship challenge but also for future students of [Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch by Facebook AI](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-pytorch--ud188).

# How can I contribute?
We would love to have contribution from other students as well and welcome all your suggestions to improve this repo. Please do not hesitate to make a pull request if you feel it can add any value to the repo, every bit of effort matters. If you have any queries, you can DM me at Slack, id is @ish. Looking forward to contributions from you. Thanks.
